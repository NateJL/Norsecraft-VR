# Norsecraft-VR
A procedurally generated Virtual Reality environment where the player can explore a Viking-era world.

## Controls
This assignment is different from the last one in the sense that you get a complete working program
to work with, and need to add functionality. The objectives of this assignment are for you to

• Left-hand joystick to control player movement.
• Left/Right middle finger trigger to grab/interact with items.

• Left/Right index finger trigger to use a held item (ie. fire a pistol).

## Notabale Features
• Procedurally generated terrain and structures using perlin noise.
• Ability to sail a ship, raising sails and steering using the VR hand controls.
